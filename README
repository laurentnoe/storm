SToRM - Seed-based TOol for SOLiD Read Mapping

[ABOUT]

 SToRM is a read mapping tool designed first for the SOLiD technology, but
 also available now for the classical Illumina technology. First, SToRM is 
 based on seeding techniques adapted to the statistical characteristics of
 reads: the seeds and the alignment algorithms are designed to comply with
 the properties of the SOLiD color encoding or Illumina substitution model, 
 as well as the observed reading error distribution along the read.

[COMPILING THE SOURCES]

 Requirements: 
    gcc (>=4.2), OpenMP support, Linux or MacOS

 Command line: 
    "make" / "make storm-color" / "make storm-nucleotide" (multithreaded)



[RUNNING SToRM]

  Command line: 
    "./storm -g <path_2_reference.fas> -r <path_2_reads.xx> [opts]"
    "./storm -h" for full parameter list

   A classic command line:
    "./storm-color      -g reference.fas -r reads.cs -l 500 -o out.sam"
    "./storm-nucleotide -g reference.fas -r reads.fq -l 500 -o out.sam"



[READING THE RESULT]

 SToRM generates its output in the SAM format. To visualise the result, we 
 recommend use of the SAMtools package (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).

 For both a SToRM output file "out.sam" and a reference file "ref.fas", the 
 samtools command lines usually are:


     samtools faidx ref.fas

     samtools view -bT ref.fas out.sam > out.bam

     ##
     ## Next line if the "-M <int>" option is set : the "out.sam"/"out.bam"
     ## are "read sorted" and not "ref sorted" in that case
     ##
     samtools sort out.bam out_sorted  

     samtools index out_sorted.bam

     samtools tview out_sorted.bam ref.fas


 Please refer to the SAMtools documentation for more usage details.
