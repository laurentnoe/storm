SToRM - Seed-based Read Mapping tool for SOLiD or Illumina sequencing data

[ABOUT]

 SToRM is a read mapping tool designed first for the SOLiD technology, but
 also available now for the classical Illumina technology. First, SToRM is 
 based on seeding techniques adapted to the statistical characteristics of
 reads: the seeds and the alignment algorithms are designed to comply with
 the properties of the SOLiD color encoding or Illumina substitution model, 
 as well as the observed reading error distribution along the read.

[COMPILING THE SOURCES]

 Requirements: 
    gcc (>=4.2), OpenMP support, Linux or MacOS

 Command line: 
    "make" / "make storm-color" / "make storm-nucleotide" (multithreaded)



[RUNNING SToRM]

  Command line: 
    "./storm -M 1 -g <path_2_reference.fas> -r <path_2_reads.xx> [opts]"
    "./storm -h" for full parameter list

   A classic command line:
    "./storm-color      -M 1 -g reference.fas -r reads.cs -l 500 -o out.sam"
    "./storm-nucleotide -M 1 -g reference.fas -r reads.fq -l 500 -o out.sam"

  Advanced command line: 

    for more sensitive mapping:

     [0] obviously, use -M <int> to have all mapable reads being mapped !!

         Otherwise, only the best read is kept per reference position,
         which implies that not all the reads (duplicates, lower quality
         ones at the same reference position) are mapped


     [1] increase the number of indels (little bit slower but secure) :
      -i 7
      -i 15 
         for full SIMD support, or even :
      -i 20
      ...
         for final alignment support only : in that case, the SIMD code 
         generates a warning explaining that il will compute at most 15
         diagonals : you can thus change the SIMD threshold -z <int> to 
         a smaller value than the final alignment threshold -t <int>.
         (see [3] below)


     [2] use smaller seeds (slower but secure ):
      -s "####-##-#-####;###-#--##-##--###;####-#---#----#--####"
      -s "##-##-###-###;###--#-#--#--####;####--#--#---#---###
      ...
      note first that iedera can help you in the seed design :
         http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/yass/iedera.php
             ./iedera -spaced -n 3 -w 11,11 -s 11,22 -r 10000 -k -l 40
             ./iedera -spaced -n 3 -w 10,10 -s 10,20 -r 10000 -k -l 40

      note also that "chain processing" can be applied in SToRM :
        unmmaped reads from the first step can be mapped in extra steps
        "./storm-nucleotide -M 1 -s <...   big seed(s) ...> -g ref.fas -r reads.fq -o out.sam -O reads2.fq"
        "./storm-nucleotide -M 1 -s <... small seed(s) ...> -g ref.fas -r reads2.fq -o out2.sam -O reads3.fq"

        e.g. an example for single seed:
          "###-##--#-##-#-###" (weight 12)
               -then-> 
          "####-#-#--##-###"   (weight 11)
               -then->
          "#####-##-###"       (weight 10)

          ./iedera -spaced -l 50 -w 12,12 -s 12,24 -r 10000 -k   
             ->  "###-##--#-##-#-###" 
          ./iedera -spaced -l 45 -w 11,11 -s 11,22 -r 10000 -k -mx "###-##--#-##-#-###"
             ->  "####-#-#--##-###"
          ./iedera -spaced -l 40 -w 10,10 -s 10,20 -r 10000 -k -mx "###-##--#-##-#-###,####-#-#--##-###"
             ->  "#####-##-###"


     [3] use smaller scores (prone to more false positives & can be slower)
      -z 85 -t 100
      -z 75 -t 90
      ...
      note that E-value "may be somehow" checked with the ALP tool:
         http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Spouge/html_ncbi/html/software/program.html?uid=6
      its also a good idea to increase these two values !!


     [4] dont use the -l parameter, or keep it with large values (> 1000)


     [5] check your quality and change the -b 33 to -b 0 (disable quality) or
         -b 64 (for some Illumina 1.5 to 1.7) accordingly ...


[READING THE RESULT]

 SToRM generates its output in the SAM format. To visualise the result, we 
 recommend use of the SAMtools package (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).

 For both a SToRM output file "out.sam" and a reference file "ref.fas", the 
 samtools command lines usually are:


     samtools faidx ref.fas

     samtools view -bT ref.fas out.sam > out.bam

     ##
     ## Next line if the "-M <int>" option is set: the "out.sam"/"out.bam"
     ## are "read sorted" and not "ref sorted" in that case
     ##
     samtools sort out.bam out_sorted  

     samtools index out_sorted.bam

     samtools tview out_sorted.bam ref.fas


 Please refer to the SAMtools documentation for more usage details.
